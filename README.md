# Laravel web application 
This web application is developed with Laravel and Node JS. It is all about Kosovo Superleauge, such as: showing results of every week and also the table of superleague. These data are fetched from an API developed with Java Spring Boot. We can also make posts about Kosovo football, if we are authenticated. There is also a chat which was developed with Node JS. In this chat, users can communicate with text, voice and video.
